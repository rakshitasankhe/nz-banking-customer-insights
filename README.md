## ✅ Objectives

- Understand patterns in customer churn
- Perform data cleaning and exploratory analysis
- Build and compare churn prediction models
- Share findings and recommendations with visuals

## 📊 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Power BI (for dashboards)
- Git & GitHub

## 🔍 Notebooks

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `01_data_cleaning.ipynb` | Cleans the raw banking data and handles missing values |
| `02_eda.ipynb` | Performs visual and statistical exploratory analysis |
| `03_churn_prediction_model.ipynb` | Trains and evaluates machine learning models to predict churn |

## 📦 Output

- `cleaned_nz_banking_data.csv`
- `random_forest_model.pkl` (saved model)

## 📈 Dashboard

A Power BI dashboard was also created using the cleaned dataset to visualize key churn indicators.

## 🧠 Key Findings

- Age and account balance are strong churn predictors.
- Inactive customers have significantly higher churn rates.
- Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression in accuracy and AUC.
