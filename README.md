# 🏦 NZ Banking Customer Insights – Churn Prediction Project

A complete data analytics project where I explored customer churn in a fictional New Zealand bank, cleaned the data, visualized patterns, and built a machine learning model to predict churn.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Understand customer demographics and account behaviors
- Identify patterns between churn and key features like region, age, and balance
- Predict whether a customer will leave (churn) using a classification model

---

## 🧠 Key Questions Answered

- What factors are linked to customer churn?
- How do age, balance, or region affect churn rates?
- Can we predict churn using historical customer data?

## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 📌 01 – Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicates, checked for missing values
- Standardized columns for age, balance, credit score, etc.

### 📊 02 – EDA & Visualization
- Visualized churn by gender, region, and account balance
- Created correlation heatmaps and boxplots

### 🤖 03 – Churn Prediction Model
- Built a logistic regression model
- Evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix

## ✅ Results Summary

- Logistic Regression Accuracy: **~X%** (fill this in!)
- Churn showed patterns across **region**, **gender**, and **account balance**
- The model can help the bank identify at-risk customers proactively

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download ZIP  
2. Open notebooks in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or Jupyter  
3. Upload the CSV file when prompted (in `data/` folder)
4. Run cells in order to replicate results

---

## 🧩 Next Steps

- Try advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Deploy with Streamlit or Flask
- Build a dashboard using Power BI or Tableau
- Automate EDA with a Python script
